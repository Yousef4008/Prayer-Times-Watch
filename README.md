# Digital Prayer Time Display System

## Overview

This embedded C project implements a digital system to display prayer times, date, time, and temperature using 7-segment displays. It features accurate timekeeping with the DS1307 RTC, city code storage in EEPROM, and a button interface for settings. Developed on the ATmega32 microcontroller, the system was designed, simulated, and tested in Proteus.

## Features

- **7-Segment Displays:** Shows prayer times, date, time, and temperature.
- **DS1307 RTC:** Ensures precise timekeeping.
- **EEPROM:** Stores city codes and prayer times data.
- **Button Interface:** Facilitates navigation and setting adjustments.
- **Embedded C Programming:** Developed on the ATmega32 microcontroller.
- **Proteus Simulation:** Tested for reliability before implementation.

## Usage

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect components as per circuit schematic.
2. **Programming:** Upload the embedded C code to the ATmega32 MCU.
3. **Operation:** Use buttons to navigate settings and view displayed information.
